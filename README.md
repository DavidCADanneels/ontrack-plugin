ontrack-jenkins
===============

This plug-in allow Jenkins to notify _[ontrack](https://github.com/nemerosa/ontrack)_ about events like build creation, status of running job, etc... but also allows Jenkins to require information from _ontrack_.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/nemerosa/ontrack-jenkins/wiki) for the documentation.
